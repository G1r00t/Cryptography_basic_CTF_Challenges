In mathematics, the Chinese remainder theorem states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer n by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of n by the product of these integers, under the condition that the divisors are pairwise coprime 

This means, that given a set of arbitrary integers ai, and pairwise coprime integers ni, such that the following linear congruences hold:

 Note "pairwise coprime integers" means that if we have a set of integers {n1, n2, ..., ni}, all pairs of integers selected from the set are coprime: gcd(ni, nj) = 1.


x ≡ a1 mod n1
x ≡ a2 mod n2
...
x ≡ an mod nn


There is a unique solution x ≡ a mod N where N = n1 * n2 * ... * nn.

x ≡ 2 mod 3
x ≡ 7 mod 13
x ≡ 9 mod 19

3 * 13 * 19
Find a such that x ≡ a mod 741
