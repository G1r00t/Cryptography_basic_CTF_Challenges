A common encoding scheme is Base64
Base64 encoding is a method of representing binary data, such as files or data streams, using a limited set of ASCII characters.
One character of a Base64 string encodes 6 binary digits (bits), and so 4 characters of Base64 encode three 8-bit bytes.

It is used at various places like in Email Attachments, Data Transmission, Data Storage
