## Introduction

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into a secure format. This repository contains a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges aimed at teaching the basics of cryptography. Each challenge is designed to focus on a specific concept or technique, helping you build a strong understanding of cryptographic principles.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Caesar Cipher

**Description**: Implement and break a Caesar Cipher, a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

**Files**: `caesar_cipher.py`

### Challenge 2: mathematics based

**Description**: Encryption schemes are very much based on mathematics so these are some basic concepts which you will need for understanding further cryptography concepts. 

**Files**: `mathematics.py`

### Challenge 3: RSA Encryption

**Description**: Learn the basics of RSA encryption, an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large integers.

**Files**: `rsa_encryption.py`

### Challenge 4: XOR Encryption

**Description**: Understand the XOR encryption technique, which is often used in symmetric key algorithms and simple obfuscation.

**Files**: `xor_encryption.py`

## Setup

To get started with these challenges, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/G1r00t/Cryptography_basic_CTF_Challenges.git
    cd Cryptography_basic_CTF_Challenges
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use
